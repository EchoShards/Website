    <p>He.....ll...ooooooo !!!!!
I am here to disturb you, annoy you as usual :)))) . Ugh, sorry i shouldn't say disturb 😂, my bad. Anyways, today is a really really special day. For you ofc, but for me too aswell. Why ??? Hey, it's my fav person's birthday, ofc this day is special for me too then. Umm, not sure where to start from 😅, let's start from the very first day i guess. 
22nd March, 2025
The very first day i started talking to you, probably the best decision of my entire life, started talking to you. Never knew or expected that you would become the most important person of my life❤️. Time passed by, we started talking more, and more and more and guess what ??? Even more 😂😂😂😂. We both have created a special bond in a very short period of time. And i really admire you and the type of person you are. Always remember, i am here for your highs and lows, if your day goes bad, get mad at me, take out your anger on me, talk with me, feel better and just stay happy. You deserve all the happiness of this entire world. You are such a pure soul, a blessing for me and your family. I want you to know that you matter a lot to me ❤️. There are less words to praise you than the qualities you have in you. If i start praising you, I'll end up running out of words lollll. If there was a way you could watch yourself from my eyes, i can guarantee you'd fall for yourself too. You are literally the nicest person i have every met, how can someone be that good ????  </p>
